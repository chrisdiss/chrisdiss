- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisdiss
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and analyzing digital products that have the potential to make a difference. 
      My background is in engineering and health so I am particular interested in those areas, 
      but nevertheless the process of using technology in general to create something new fascinates and thrives me.
- 🌱 I’m into data science with python because knowing and predicting what happens is the first step for building the right thing. 
      I also developed a deep understanding of product management processes from user research to product vision and backlog management.
      I constantly thrive to get a deeper understanding of digital technologies, especially AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn from others and gain experience by contributing to the project.
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn.
